# Best Practices and Todo's

# Security
- ✅ **AWS IAM roles with least privilege**: Implemented roles with minimal permissions needed.
- ✅ **ECR image scanning enabled**: Auto vulnerability scanning on image push to detect security issues.
- ✅ **Data encryption (S3, ECR)**: All data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS for enhanced security.
- ✅ **Private subnets for EKS**: EKS nodes run in private subnets to prevent direct internet access.
- ❌ **Automated credential rotation**: Not implemented due to dev environment.

## Cost Optimization

- ✅ **Auto-scaling**: Implemented to automatically adjust resources based on traffic.
- ✅ **Resource cleanup**: Terraform destroy workflows ensure unused resources are removed.
- ✅ **Right-sized instances**: Using base instance types according to the app needs.
- ❌ **Spot instances**: Not implemented due to workload interruptions and failovers.

## Performance
- ✅ **Cluster autoscaling**: EKS cluster scales nodes.
- ✅ **Container resource limits**: Set CPU and memory limits.
- ✅ **Metrics server**: Installed to provide resource metrics for autoscaling decisions.
- ✅ **Horizontal pod autoscaling**: Configured to scale application pods based on CPU utilization.
- ❌ **CloudFront CDN**: Not implemented due to dev environment. would improve global performance and reduce latency.

## Monitoring
- ✅ **CloudWatch alerts**: Set up to notify on critical system events.
- ✅ **Cluster metrics**: Collecting performance data from EKS cluster.
- ✅ **Container logs**: Centralized logging for application containers.
- ✅ **CloudWatch dashboard**: Provides a visual overview of key metrics.

## DevOps Culture
- ✅ **IaC (Terraform)**: All infrastructure defined and versioned as code.
- ✅ **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**: Automated build and deployment pipeline for consistent delivery.
- ✅ **Version control**: All code and configuration stored in Git with proper branching.
- ✅ **Environment variables**: Used for configuration to avoid hardcoded values.
- ✅ **S3 state backup**: Terraform state stored in S3 with versioning for reliability.

## Priority TODOs
1. **Implement credential rotation**: Set up AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation for improved security.
2. **Add cost monitoring**: Configure AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer with alerts for better cost control.
3. **Configure error tracking**: Implement a solution like CloudWatch Insights for application error monitoring.
4. **Enable security scanning**: Set up tools like AWS Security Hub or Prisma Cloud for continuous security assessment.
